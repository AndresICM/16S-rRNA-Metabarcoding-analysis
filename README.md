# 16S-rRNA-Metabarcoding-analysis
Tutorial for the analysis of 16S rRNA metabarcoding sequences using Illumina pairend reads. This tutorial is based on the MiSeq SOP pipeline (https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/ Schloss et al., 2013.)

## Introduction

Sequences were generated using data from a hydrocarbon bioremediation project. Two treatments were selected for this tutorial, a bioaugmentation with *Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas* and *Rhodococcus* strains, and a control.
